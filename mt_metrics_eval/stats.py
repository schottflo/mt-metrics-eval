"""Correlations and related functions.

This module provides:

- A wrapper (AverageCorrelation) that applies vector-based correlation functions
  to matrices in different ways, and a convenience class (Correlation) that
  stores gold and metric scores, and facilitates calling AverageCorrelation on
  them.
- Various vector-based correlation functions not implemented in scipy.stats;
  currently these are all variants on Kendall's Tau.
- Statistical tests (Williams and Permutation) for determining whether the
  difference between two correlations is significant.

class Correlation:
  """Data and algorithms for computing correlations.

  This class stores gold and metric scores, and lets you compute different
  correlation statistics for them. The scores can be at the "system"-level
  (conceptually, a single vector) or at the "segment"-level (conceptuatlly,
  a matrix of system x item scores). Both are stored as vectors. The gold scores
  may also contain None values, which are filtered out, in parallel with the
  corresponding metric scores, before computing correlations.

  All correlation functions take an 'average_by' argument that describes how a
  matrix of segment-level scores gets converted into vectors in order to compute
  correlations: 'none' - flatten the matrix into two long vectors; 'sys' -
  compute correlations over corresponding row vectors, then average; or 'item' -
  compute correlations over corresponding column vectors, then average. For
  system-level scores, 'none' is the only option that makes sense.

  For simplicity, the correlation functions here all take only the 'average_by'
  argument, in addition to arguments that are specific to the actual correlation
  statistic. The AverageCorrelation class supports a few other averaging
  options; use that class directly if you need those.

  Uses the PERM-BOTH permutation test advocated by
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00054 to decide if the correlation for the metric
  in corr2 is significantly greater than that in corr1. Returns a p-value for
  the hypothesis that metric2 correlates better, or equivalently 1 minus the
  p-value for the hypothesis that metric1 correlates better.

  Args:
    corr1: Statistics for metric1.
    corr2: Statistics for metric2.
    corr_fcn: Function that maps two float vectors, followed by optional
      additional arguments, to a correlation value, followed by
      optional additional elements. KendallVariants and KendallWithTiesOpt

    average_by: Either 'sys', 'item' or 'none' to group by rows, columns, or
      neither.
    k: Number of resampling runs.
    params: Additional minor parameters, see PermutationSigDiffParams.
    replace_nans_with_zeros: When averaging, replace NaNs with 0 rather than
      removing them from the average. No-op if corr_fcn is KendallWithTiesOpt.
